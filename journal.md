- week of 1/17
Looked into Wilds benchmark (https://wilds.stanford.edu/) and scoped out a representation learning project.
TODO: set up datasets and start thinking about baseline methods to evaluate.

Learned about cmip6 dataset and thinking about alternative project where I fit an implicit function (energy based model) to the data. Could be an interesting way to combine the predictions from many models? Have to see how the ensembling in cmip6 is done already. My understanding is that all of this is simulation data, not raw data, but could still be a cool exploration.
